An embedded device, quite different from the "Telegraph" example, is a home blood pressure monitor.  It requires a user display, pushbutton inputs, 
control of the inflator motor, and sensors for pressure measurements.  Fortunately the design doesn't have tight throughput and response requirements, but as a medical device its
reliability is critical.  Being a home unit and battery powered, cost and power consumption are very important.  Typically the device stores its results so NVM is required. 
There is some mathematical processing required as well, to convert the sensor readings into a human readable systolic and diastolic display. This type of device typically 
doesn't get software updates, so it is imperative that the code be implemented correctly and tested very thoroughly, as bugs can't be corrected (or tolerated).
